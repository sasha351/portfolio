									This site's purpose is to serve as a hub for all my project and any other niche side interests I aquire throughtout my academic future. The idea came to me after a very helpful
									upperclassman teacher's assistant in my digital systems class. His site contained a course guide that he made for future undergraduates that contained simply written course summaries
									and tips about professors. <u>This saved me</u>. I had chosen to abandon the recommended course order due to some AP credit and we feeling completely lost. I decided to emulate his project
									and hopefully accumulate something that would help other CompE students at UMass.

								<h2>Why bother with all that code?</h2>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/project-photos/gitAndGithub.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									<b>Here's why this wasn't a good idea: </b>This site was built using a very helpful template I found online, so it isn't really unique. It is a total pain to manually go into the code files in order to write a project summary, instead
									of editing a wix page. It is <u>especially</u> a pain to figure out how to center all these text boxes and photos (an infamous web dev headache) and make everything look pretty. This could have 
									been a collection of word docs and canva designs popped into google slide, or even a wordpress site. Heck, I could've even had github copilot or blackbox AI write something for me. 
									<br><br>
									<b>Why you should also do this: </b>I chose to do this the spring of my freshman year to get myself more comfortable working in IDE's and to teach myself GIT. <u>Coding is really intimidating</u> and this project served as an "I can do this" start to my
									journey of programming. Having a project under your belt that you can say is yours feels really good. I remember putting the finishing touches on it before I had my first tech job
									interview and getting asked about it during the sit-down with my future boss. I can't really say for sure if having this site was the deciding factor that got me the job, but the confidence
									I gained from it helped me do more web dev work in that position. Learning how to navigate github and working with git was a huge plus for sure.
