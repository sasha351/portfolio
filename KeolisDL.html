                        The summer after my sophomore year of college I worked for Keolis, a transportation and mobility
                        company that's contracted by the MBTA to run their commuter rail system. Throughout the summer I gained valuable experience 
                        working with microcontrollers and prototying a project.
                        I was initially tasked with creating an Arduino-based system that would read the pressure from
                        the HVAC transducers and write them to a micro SD card for later analysis.
                        As I began to explore tackling this problem, my boss and I soon realized that this device could
                        be used for much more. In its final version, my project turned into more of a cabin comfort
                        monitoring device. It used a variety of sensors to measure coach C02 levels, coach temperature,
                        filter pressure (for determining how dirty the filters were), coach humidity, and the pressure
                        from the transducers
                        while showing the pressures live on an OLED display as well as logging all the information to a
                        CSV file on the micro SD card.

                        The script went through 8ish versions (deployed in phases - thank you Prof. Leonard - as I
                        started integrating more sensors) and went the build an assembly when
                        through 3 versions, referred to as MK1 - MK3 throughout the post.

                        <code>Pictured Right: MK1 - The fist version of the device laid out on a breadboard</code>

                    <h3>Version History Summary:</h3>
                    <li>MK1 - Based on the Arduino Uno R3. Outgrew this board as the scope of the project increased, I
                        actually ran out of memory on the board</li>
                    <li>MK2 - Switched to an ESP32, got all the specs we needed and this version was breadboard based
                    </li>
                    <li>MK3 - New board layout & wiring because everything got moved to the perfboard. Much smaller and
                        everything was soldered down to make it more robust than MK2</li>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Parts List (MK3):</h3>

                    <li>uC - Arduino Nano ESP32 </li>
                    <li>Perf Boards - ElectroCookie Double 1/2 size</li>
                    <li>RTC - DS3231 real-time clock (RTC) </li>
                    <li>SD Card Reader - ADA254 </li>
                    <li>2 x Power Sensor - INA260 </li>
                    <li>Display - SSD1106 </li>
                    <li>2 x Barometric Sensor - BMP280 </li>
                    <li>Co2, Humidity, Temperature Sensor - SCD41 </li>
                    <li>Assorted wires, terminal block connectors, capacitors, power supplies</li>

                    <h3>Project Challenges & Setbacks</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <h4><li>Fail, Fail, and Fail again</li></h4>

                        The biggest thing I learned throughout my 10 weeks at Keolis was how many setbacks you face when taking
                        a project from start to finish. At first, most of my problems were related to sensor incompatibilities. I was working 
                        with more sensors than I ever had and was running into issues with their communication protocols. I read through forums 
                        and stack overflow posts until I learned enough to fix my issue, gaining an understanding of SPI and I2C protocols in the
                        process. I found prototyping to be a frustrating but also incredibly rewarding process. The lows were filled with challanges of
                         of a seemingly unsolvable bug and the highs were marked by infinite joy of getting the hardware to finally cooperate and a working
                         project slowly taking form. The key to moving forward with this process was integrating everything in phases and making the project seem
                         smaller than it actually was.
                    </ol>
                    <ol>
                        <h4><li>Being part of a the bigger picture</li></h4>

                        This next statement seems obvious but holds lots of importance - running a railroad is complicated. 
                    </ol>
