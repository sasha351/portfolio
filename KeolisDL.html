                        The summer after my sophomore year of college I worked for Keolis, a transportation and mobility
                        company that's contracted by the MBTA to run their commuter rail system. Throughout the summer I gained valuable experience 
                        working with micro-controllers and prototyping a project.
                        I was initially tasked with creating an Arduino-based system that would read the pressure from
                        the HVAC transducers and write them to a micro SD card for later analysis.
                        As I began to explore tackling this problem, my boss and I soon realized that this device could
                        be used for much more. In its final version, my project turned into more of a cabin comfort
                        monitoring device. It used a variety of sensors to measure coach C02 levels, coach temperature,
                        filter pressure (for determining how dirty the filters were), coach humidity, and the pressure
                        from the transducers
                        while showing the pressures live on an OLED display as well as logging all the information to a
                        CSV file on the micro SD card.

                        Over the course of the summer I greatly improved on my embedded systems programming and soldering skills. This device was the most complicated
                        embedded systems project that I had built from start to finish up to this point. Integrating the design onto a perf-board was a test of my 
                        soldering abilities and forced me to get good at using the iron and pump. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity that Keolis gave me to learn
                        and grow on the job. The script I wrote went through nine versions and the case assembly went
                        through 3 versions, referred to as MK1 - MK3 throughout the post.

                    <h3>Version History Summary:</h3>
                    <li>MK1 - Based on the Arduino Uno R3. Outgrew this board as the scope of the project increased, I
                        actually ran out of memory on the board</li>
                    <li>MK2 - Switched to an ESP32, got all the specs we needed and this version was breadboard based
                    </li>
                    <li>MK3 - New board layout & wiring because everything got moved to the perfboard. Much smaller and
                        everything was soldered down to make it more robust than MK2</li>

                        <h4>Fail, Fail, and Fail again</h4>

                        The biggest thing I learned throughout my 10 weeks at Keolis was how many setbacks you face when taking
                        a project from start to finish. At first, most of my problems were related to sensor incompatibilities. I was working 
                        with more sensors than I ever had and was running into issues with their communication protocols. I read through forums 
                        and stack overflow posts until I learned enough to fix my issue, gaining an understanding of SPI and I2C protocols in the
                        process. I found prototyping to be a frustrating but also incredibly rewarding process. The lows were filled with challanges of
                         of a seemingly unsolvable bug and the highs were marked by infinite joy of getting the hardware to finally cooperate and a working
                         project slowly taking form. The key to moving forward with this process was integrating everything in phases and making the project seem
                         smaller than it actually was.

                        <h4>Being part of a the bigger picture</h4>

                        This next statement seems obvious but holds lots of importance - running a railroad is complicated. When it came to installing my
                        data logger onto the train, I had to be very mindful of my timing. Working around the commuter rail schedule was the easy part, the challange
                        was having enough time as well as the right people to do the device install. Time on the coach was always limited because it's a top 
                        priority to keep as many locomotives and coaches running as possible. I also always needed a carman and electrician with me when making changes to
                        the air vent wiring or drilling new holes. Collecting the right people at the right time proved difficult and illuminated just how big the scale of
                        what I was working on was.

                    <li>
                        <h4>Scope Creep</h4>

                        The initial idea for what my project was going to do was much simpler than what the final product ended up as. After a few talks with my manager, we
                        realized that given the positioning of the device in the AC vent and the versatility of the Arduino Nano ESP32 this logger could do much more. This meant more R&D and 
                        a much cooler project. As a result, I added 3 more sensors and a display to the logger. This taught me that, especially for prototypes, you have to be adaptable. You never know
                        when a new idea could pop into your head and severely change what you're doing. Although the changes my manager requested I implemented made the project more challenging it also increased
                        my interest and turned into motivation to push through the bugs.
