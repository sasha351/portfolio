							<h2>Photography</h2>
						</header>
						<p>In my free time I work as a freelance photographer. I specialize in event photography and portraits, however
							in my free time I love to do some urban exploring to get some shots of the cities in my area.</p>
						<p>
							You can find my work on <a href="https://unsplash.com/@knox0" target ="_blank" rel="noopener noreference">Unsplash</a> 
							and on my Instagram account for photography. Addittionally, in the summer of 2023, I did some private pro-bono work for a 
							New Hampshire summer camp for 4 weeks. During that time I not only got to be the
							photographer but I also taught an introductory photo workshop to kids aged 12-16.
